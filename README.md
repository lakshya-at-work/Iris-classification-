Streamlit Multi-Class Classification App
This project presents a user-friendly Streamlit application for multi-class classification using machine learning algorithms.

# Functionality:

Users can interactively set input parameters through sliders, text boxes, or other Streamlit widgets.
Based on the provided parameters, the application predicts a class out of three possible categories using a pre-trained machine learning model.
The predicted class along with relevant information is displayed for user interpretation.

# Technology Stack:

Streamlit: Streamlines the creation of web applications for machine learning.
Machine Learning Library :scikit-learn
Provides classification algorithms :logistic ,linea and svm 

# Model:

The application utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for multi-class classification.
